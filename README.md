## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  My name is Michael Rios. Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University-Victoria, and Iâ€™ve been programming for about a year. Iâ€™m still learning,
  figuring things out as I go, and building projects that help me grow. Most of what I know comes from trial and error and a lot of curiosity.
  Right now Iâ€™m focused on desktop apps using Python for the interface and C++ for the backend. I enjoy working with systems that feel clean and modular, 
  even if Iâ€™m still learning how to design them well. Sharing my work helps me stay motivated and connect with others who are learning too. 
  Iâ€™m proud of what Iâ€™ve built so far, and Iâ€™m excited to keep going.

</p>
