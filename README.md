## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  ## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

  Hi, I'm Michael Rios â€” a Computer Science student at Texas A&M Universityâ€“Victoria and the developer behind KingNeoIV. I specialize in building standalone desktop apps with Python GUIs and C++ backends, with a focus on modular design, 
  performance, and educational impact. Iâ€™m passionate about systems-level thinking, ethical tech, and sharing my work publicly to help others learn and grow. Every project I publish reflects my journey â€” persistent, methodical, and 
  built from the ground up.
